# About Droogger
## Our Mission
Droogger exists to explain internet theories, myths, and conspiracies in plain language. We don’t promote them — we document and clarify them, so readers can understand where these ideas come from, how they spread, and why people believe them.

In a world flooded with half-truths, rumors, and viral claims, Droogger’s goal is simple: dig deeper, explain clearly, and let you decide what to believe.

## Why the Name “Droogger”?
### The word Droogger has two origins.
Our interpretation today: “Droogger” suggests digging — uncovering what’s buried beneath the noise of the internet. Just as a digger uncovers hidden layers, we uncover the background behind conspiracy theories and misinformation.

The real story: The name actually comes from A Clockwork Orange, where the main character calls his friends his droogs. It turns out “droog” comes from the Russian word for buddy or partner. Back when I first heard it, I just thought it sounded cool — and later, when I needed a domain name, I added “-er” to it. (Finding an “-er” name that isn’t already taken is surprisingly hard!)

Both stories reflect what Droogger is about: a place to explore ideas together and dig beneath the surface.

## Who We Are
Droogger is an independent project built for curious people. Whether you’ve stumbled across terms like chemtrails, QAnon, or flat earth and wondered “What does that even mean?” — we’re here to give you the background without the hype.

We’re not here to convince you, recruit you, or push an agenda. We’re here to explain.
