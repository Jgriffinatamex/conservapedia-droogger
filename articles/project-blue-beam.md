# What is Project Blue Beam

Project Blue Beam is one of the most enduring conspiracy theories connecting advanced technology, religion, and global control. First introduced by Canadian journalist [Serge Monast](https://www.warwicks.com/book/9798875840876) in the 1990s, the theory claims that NASA and world governments are secretly developing technology to simulate the Second Coming of Christ (or other religious figures) in the sky, uniting humanity under a [New World Order](https://www.middlebury.edu/institute/academics/centers-initiatives/ctec/ctec-publications/new-world-order-historical-origins-dangerous)

But what exactly did Monast propose, and how has this theory evolved over time?
