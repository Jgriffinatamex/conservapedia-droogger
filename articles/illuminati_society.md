# What is The Illuminati?
The Illuminati refers to both a real historical group and a modern myth. The original Bavarian Illuminati was founded in 1776 in Germany, a secret society promoting enlightenment values and opposition to religious control. It was banned within a decade.

<summary>## The Conspiracy Theory</summary>
Today, “Illuminati” is used to describe a supposed secret elite group controlling world events. Popular claims include:

- Hidden hand in global politics and finance
- Influence over celebrities and pop culture
- Use of symbols (like the “all-seeing eye” or pyramid) as secret signals

<summary>## The Reality</summary>
- Historians agree the original Illuminati disbanded by the late 1700s.
- Modern claims are based on speculation, pattern-spotting, and pop culture references rather than evidence.
- The myth survives because it’s a “catch-all” theory for explaining power and inequality.

The Illuminati narrative appeals because it offers a simple answer to complex global issues. It also thrives in music, movies, and memes, where symbols are fun to interpret.
