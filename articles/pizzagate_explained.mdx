# What is Pizzagate?
Pizzagate is a conspiracy theory that began during the 2016 U.S. presidential election. It falsely claimed that a child trafficking ring was being run out of a Washington, D.C. pizzeria called Comet Ping Pong, allegedly linked to political figures.

## How It Spread
The theory grew out of misinterpreted “Podesta emails” leaked by WikiLeaks. Online forums, blogs, and social media amplified the claims, often tying them to broader QAnon-style narratives.

## The Reality
No evidence has ever supported these claims.
The pizzeria and its employees were harassed and threatened.
In December 2016, a man entered the restaurant with a rifle to “investigate.” No trafficking or criminal activity was found.
## Why It Matters
Pizzagate showed how internet rumors can escalate into real-world danger, serving as a precursor to the rise of QAnon and other large-scale online conspiracy movements.
