# What Is ʻOumuamua?
Discovered in 2017, ʻOumuamua (meaning “scout” in Hawaiian) was the first confirmed interstellar object to pass through our solar system. Its elongated, cigar-like shape and unusual acceleration sparked worldwide fascination.

## Why Is It Controversial?
ʻOumuamua did not behave like typical asteroids or comets. Its acceleration couldn’t be fully explained by gravity alone, leading some researchers—most notably Avi Loeb—to suggest it might be an alien probe. Most astronomers, however, attribute the acceleration to natural outgassing or solar radiation pressure.

## Fact vs. Fiction

| Claim |  Reality |
|---|---|
| ʻOumuamua is an alien spacecraft. | Speculative. No evidence confirms this. |
| It’s an asteroid or comet fragment. | Supported by mainstream science, though unusual. |
| Its acceleration proves intelligent design. | More likely explained by outgassing or solar effects. |
| ʻOumuamua is unique. | It’s the first confirmed interstellar object, but not the last. |
