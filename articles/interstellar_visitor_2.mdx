# What Is Comet Borisov?

Discovered in 2019 by amateur astronomer Gennadiy Borisov, 2I/Borisov was the second confirmed interstellar object and the first that clearly looked like a comet.

## Why Is It Important?
Unlike ʻOumuamua, Borisov showed classic comet features: a bright tail, visible outgassing, and a chemical composition very similar to comets found in our own solar system. Its discovery strengthened the idea that interstellar comets may be more common than once thought.

## Fact vs. Fiction

| Claim |  Reality |
|---|---|
| Borisov was an alien craft. | No evidence supports this. It behaved like a normal comet. |
| Borisov proves interstellar comets are common. | Likely true — its detection suggests many such objects exist. |
| Borisov was unique. | Unique only in being the first interstellar comet observed. |

## Final Thoughts
Comet Borisov is considered the most “ordinary” interstellar visitor so far, behaving like comets we know well. Its appearance reinforces the idea that our galaxy is filled with wandering ice-and-dust bodies, some of which occasionally pass through our solar system.
